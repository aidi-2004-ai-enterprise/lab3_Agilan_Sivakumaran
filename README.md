# Lab 3 - Penguins Classifier with XGBoost and FastAPI üêß

This is a fun project where I built a machine learning model to guess the type of penguin (species) based on some of its features. I used a dataset from the Seaborn library and trained a model using XGBoost. Then, I created a FastAPI app so you can send penguin info and get a prediction.
